 Hi. My name is Nick. I have always loved making cool maps and mod content for the community. I also think that helping others is important. 
Iâ€™ve uploaded all of the source files that I made to make this deathstar map for L4D2. 
You can use these source files to make your own awesome mods and community content.

## Using these files for your own projects

If you do use my materials as starter files, then please put my name somewhere in your credits and email me at: "nickbuonarota@gmail.com" to let me know about the cool project that you are working on. I'd love to hear about it, and maybe I could help make your project more awesome by talking to you about it!

## Contributing to my project

If you want to colaborate and help me finish this map, then also email me at "nickbuonarota@gmail.com" and we can talk about it.

## What not to do!

Also, please don't use any source files you get here to sell for profit. That would defeat the purpose of me putting them up here for free to help you make your own cool side projects and community content.
