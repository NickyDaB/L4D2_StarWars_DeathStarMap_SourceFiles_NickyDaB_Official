// Mission files describe the metadata needed by campaign-specific add-ons so they can be
// integrated into Left4Dead. The data in this file is used by the game UI, matchmaking and server.
// Although you may provide multiple Campaigns in one add-on by putting more than one .TXT file 
// in the missions folder, it's generally a good idea to stick to one per add-on.
//
// HOW TO DEBUG MISSION FILES:
//	In the console set "developer 2"
//	Then type "mission_reload"
// This will make the game reload all the mission files and print out every chapter for every mode it
// finds.  It's very useful to ensure that your mission file is being correctly read.

	// Use a short name, since it is used as a tag on the servers for matching
	// your campaign when looking for a dedicated server.  Generally it should
	// be something unique.  One suggestion to is use your initials and a short
	// abbreviated name for your campaign. Avoid spaces and special characters.
	// Do not change the name when you create a revision, as the matchmaking
        // system will consider it a different campaign. Instead, use "Version" and 
        // "DisplayTitle" below to indicate revisions.

	// The version number is used when finding campaigns on dedicated servers

	// who has a newer version, you will be directed to download the new

	// should be the home page for your campaign and it should provide a
